This is a zero-dependency React adaptation of John W. Long's (jlong) [css-spinners](https://github.com/jlong/css-spinners) library.

# Usage

## Install from NPM
```bash
npm install css-spinners-react
```

## Import the spinner components

### Import all the spinners in a namespaced fashion
You can import all the spinners at once:
```js
import * as Spinners from 'css-spinners-react';
```
and use them in a namespaced manner:
```js
<Spinners.Ball />
```

### Import an individual spinner 
You can also import a single loader:
```js
import { Ball } from 'css-spinners-react'
```
and use it without any fancy namespacing:
```js
<Ball />
```
